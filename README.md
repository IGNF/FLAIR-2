## Context & Data

The FLAIR #2 dataset is sampled countrywide and is composed of over 20 billion annotated pixels of very high resolution aerial imagery at 0.2 m spatial resolution, acquired over three years and different months (spatio-temporal domains). Aerial imagery patches consist of 5 channels (RVB-Near Infrared-Elevation) and have corresponding annotation (with 19 semantic classes or 13 for the baselines). Furthermore, to integrate broader spatial context and temporal information, high resolution Sentinel-2 1-year time series with 10 spectral band are also provided. More than 50,000 Sentinel-2 acquisitions with 10 m spatial resolution are available.

## Baseline model 

A two-branch architecture integrating a U-Net <a href="https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Link%20to-SMP-f4dbaa.svg"/></a> with a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder and a U-TAE <a href="https://github.com/VSainteuf/utae-paps"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Link%20to-U--TAE-f4dbaa.svg"/></a> encompassing a temporal self-attention encoder is presented. The U-TAE branch aims at learning spatio-temporal embeddings from the high resolution satellite time series that are further integrated into the U-Net branch exploiting the aerial imagery. The proposed _U-T&T_ model features a fusion module to extend and reshape the U-TAE embeddings in order to add them towards the U-Net branch.

## Usage 

The `flair-2-config.yml` file controls paths, hyperparameters and computing ressources. The file `requirement.txt` is listing used libraries for the baselines.

To launch a training/inference/metrics computation, you can either use : 

- ```
  main.py --config_file=flair-2-config.yml
  ```

-  use the `./notebook/flair-2-notebook.ipynb` notebook guiding you through data visualization, training and testing steps.

A toy dataset (reduced size) is available to check that your installation and the information in the configuration file are correct.

## Leaderboard

Please note that for participants to the FLAIR #2 challenge on CodaLab, a certain number of constraints must be satisfied (in particular, inference time). All infos are available on the _Overview_ page of the competion.

| Model|Input|mIoU 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
| baseline U-Net (ResNet34) | aerial imagery | 0.5470
| baseline U-Net (ResNet34) + _metadata + augmentation_ | aerial imagery | 0.5593
|||
| baseline U-T&T | aerial and satellite imagery | 0.5594
| baseline U-T&T + _filter clouds + monthly averages + data augmentation_ | aerial and satellite imagery | 0.5758

If you want to submit a new entry, you can open a new issue.
<b> Results of the challenge will be reported after the end of the challenge early October! </b>

The baseline U-T&T + _filter clouds + monthly averages + data_augmentation_ obtains the following confusion matrix:
